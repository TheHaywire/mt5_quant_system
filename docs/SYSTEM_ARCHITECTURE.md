# MT5 Quant Trading System Architecture

## System Overview

The MT5 Quant Trading System is a production-grade, automated trading platform that implements multi-timeframe analysis, risk management, and real-time execution. This document explains the system's architecture, components, and workflow.

## Core Components

### 1. Market Data Processing (`mt5_connector.py`)
- **Connection Management**
  - Establishes and maintains connection with MT5 terminal
  - Handles reconnection and error recovery
  - Manages session state and authentication

- **Data Fetching**
  - Real-time tick data collection
  - OHLCV data retrieval across multiple timeframes
  - Symbol information and market depth

### 2. Strategy Engine (`strategy.py`)
- **Signal Generation**
  - Multi-timeframe analysis (M1, M5, M15, H1, H4, D1)
  - Technical indicator calculations
  - Signal strength computation
  - Trade setup identification

- **Technical Analysis**
  - RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands
  - Volume analysis
  - Trend detection
  - Support/Resistance levels

### 3. Trade Execution (`trade_executor.py`)
- **Position Management**
  - Entry order placement
  - Stop-loss and take-profit management
  - Position sizing based on risk parameters
  - Break-even and trailing stop logic

- **Risk Management**
  - Kelly-capped position sizing
  - Maximum drawdown protection
  - Correlation-based exposure limits
  - Per-trade risk limits

### 4. Display System (`display_manager.py`)
- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - Market data display
  - Position status
  - System health metrics
  - Trade signals and alerts

## Trading Workflow

1. **Initialization**
   ```
   MT5 Connection → Account Validation → Market Data Initialization
   ```

2. **Market Analysis**
   ```
   Data Collection → Indicator Calculation → Signal Generation → Setup Identification
   ```

3. **Trade Execution**
   ```
   Setup Validation → Risk Check → Order Placement → Position Management
   ```

4. **Risk Management**
   ```
   Position Sizing → Stop Management → Exposure Control → Drawdown Protection
   ```

## Key Features

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- Weighted signal aggregation across timeframes
- Trend confluence detection
- Timeframe-specific indicator settings

### Risk Management
- Dynamic position sizing (1% risk per trade)
- Maximum drawdown protection (20%)
- Correlation-based exposure limits
- Per-symbol position limits

### Trade Execution
- Automated entry/exit
- Break-even management
- Trailing stops
- Slippage control

### System Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics
- Health checks
- Error logging
- Trade journaling

## Configuration

The system is configured through `config.py`:

```python
# Trading Parameters
SYMBOLS = ["EURUSD", "GBPUSD", "USDJPY", "XAUUSD"]
TIMEFRAMES = [M1, M5, M15, H1, H4, D1]
RISK_PER_TRADE = 0.01  # 1% per trade
MAX_DRAWDOWN = 0.20    # 20% maximum drawdown

# Strategy Parameters
RSI_PERIOD = 14
MACD_FAST = 12
MACD_SLOW = 26
MACD_SIGNAL = 9
```

## Performance Metrics
